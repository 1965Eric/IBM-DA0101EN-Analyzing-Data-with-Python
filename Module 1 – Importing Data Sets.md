# Learning Objectives

* Analyze Python data using a dataset
* Identify three Python libraries and describe their uses
* Read data using Python's Pandas package
* Demonstrate how to import and export data in Python

## Practice Quiz: Understanding the Data

Question 1: Each column contains a:

- A. [ ] different used car
- B. [X] attribute or feature

## Practice Quiz: Python Packages for Data Science

Question 1: What description best describes the library Pandas?

- A. [ ] Includes functions for some advanced math problems as listed in the slide as well as data visualization.
- B. [X] Offers data structure and tools for effective data manipulation and analysis. It provides fast access to structured data. The primary instrument of Pandas is a two-dimensional table consisting of columns and rows labels which are called a DataFrame. It is designed to provide an easy indexing function.
- C. [ ] Uses arrays as their inputs and outputs. It can be extended to objects for matrices, and with a little change of coding, developers perform fast array processing.

## Practice Quiz: Importing and Exporting Data in Python

Question 1: Some common encodings are ...

- A. [X] csv
- B. [X] xlsx
- C. [ ] Pandas

Question 2: What does the following method do to the dataframe? df : df.head(12)

- A. [X] Show the first 12 rows of dataframe.
- B. [ ] Shows the bottom 12 rows of dataframe.
