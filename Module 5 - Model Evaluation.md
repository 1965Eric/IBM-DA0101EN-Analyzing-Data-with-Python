# Learning Objectives

* Describe data model refinement techniques
* Explain overfitting, underfitting, and model selection
* Apply ridge regression to regularize and reduce the standard errors to avoid overfitting a regression model
* Apply grid search techniques to Python data

## Practice Quiz: Model Evaluation

Question 1: What function randomly splits a dataset into training and testing subsets

- A. [ ] ```cross_val_predict```
- B. [ ] ```cross_val_score```
- C. [X] ```train_test_split```

## Practice Quiz: Overfitting, Underfitting and Model Selection

Question 1: In the following plot, the vertical axis shows the mean square error and the horizontal axis represents the order of the polynomial. The red line represents the training error the blue line is the test error. Should you select the 16 order polynomial.
