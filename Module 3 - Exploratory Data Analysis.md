- A. [X] positive linear relationship
- B. [ ] negative linear relationship

## Practice Quiz: GroupBy in Python

Question 1: Select the appropriate description of a pivot table:

- A. [ ] A pivot table contains statistical information for each column.
- B. [X] A pivot table has one variable displayed along the columns and the other variable displayed along the rows.

## Practice Quiz: Correlation

Question 1: Select the scatter plot with weak correlation:

- A. [ ]

## Practice Quiz: Correlation - Statistics

Question 1: Consider the following scatter plots a,b and c. What plot would have the highest correlation coefficient? (Note: this one is harder than it seems)

- A. [ ] a
- B. [ ] b
- C. [ ] c
- D. [X] They all have the same value

## Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you have learned how to:

* **Describe Exploratory Data Analysis**: By summarizing the main characteristics of the data and extracting valuable insights.
* **Compute basic descriptive statistics**: Calculate the mean, median, and mode using python and use it as a basis in understanding the distribution of the data.
* **Create data groups**: How and why you put continuous data in groups and how to visualize them.
* **Define correlation as the linear association between two numerical variables**: Use Pearson correlation as a measure of the correlation between two continuous variables
* **Define the association between two categorical variables**: Understand how to find the association of two variables using the Chi-square test for association and how to interpret them.
